      "The three semantic tags that must be on every page are header, main, and footer. These are required for organisation and accessibility

      Most semantic tags are containers. Just putting text within them without a <p> or <h> tag is not acceptable, with the exception of

            "<span id="definition">The Legend of Zelda</span>: Tears of the Kingdom is the upcoming twentieth main installment in The Legend of
            Zelda series. The game is scheduled to be released on May 12, 2023 on the Nintendo Switch. Development of the game began in 2017
            after the production for Breath of the Wild concluded. During the E3 2019 Nintendo Direct, it was announced that it would be a
            sequel to Breath of the Wild. The idea of creating a direct sequel came from the fact that Eiji Aonuma, producer of Breath of the
            Wild, wanted to revisit the same Hyrule while incorporating a new story and gameplay mechanics. Initially, new ideas were thought
            of for DLC but evolved into a new game when too many were gathered."
